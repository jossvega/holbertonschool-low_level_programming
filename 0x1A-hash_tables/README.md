# 0x1A. C - Hash tables
---
## Description
Repository to study the following Python topics: Hash tables topic in C. Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you will be done with this project, you will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries. 

- What is a hash function
- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables
